* Reproducible research						     :export:

Reproducible research is the idea that scientific claims are published:
 - with their data 
 - software code used to analyze them

* Clarebout's principal						     :export:
#+Begin_quote
 "An article about computational result is advertising, not
 scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment,
 code and data, that produced the result."
#+end_quote
Claerbout and Karrenbach, Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics. 1992

* Tie code to figure						     :export:
    
#+begin_quote
    "When we publish articles containing figures which were generated
    by computer, we also publish the complete software environment
    which generates the figures” 
#+end_quote

** Cancer research
   - In 2012, an Amgen team tried to reproduce important resutls
   - pre-clinical targets for cancer 
   - 47 out of 53 medical research papers 
   - were irreproducible

([[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html]])

** Psychology
 -  Researchers explained in a 2006 study that, of 249 data sets from
    American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 73% of
    contacted authors did not respond with their data over a 6-month
    period.

** Economics

    - High debt-to-gdp and low gdp growth are associated 
    - Made their calculations in Excel

** Computer Science

Christian Collberg (http://reproducibility.cs.arizona.edu/v1/tr.pdf) looked 
at the papers in eight conferences and five ACM journals.  They were able 
to reproduce 102 out 613 papers 24.9%

   
** History of reproducible research
*** Mathematics
 - First proofs Greeks (ca. 400 B.C.E.)
   - Pythagoras (569–500 B.C.E.) proofs
   - Euclid of Alexandria (325 B.C.E.–265 B.C.E.) axioms and definitions
   - Eudoxus (408 B.C.E–355 B.C.E.) theorems
   - William of Occam (1288 C.E.–1348 C.E.) fewest steps
*** Advances in mathematics and proof
    - Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) 
      - expansion of an arbitrary function into a trigonometric series
    - Evariste Galois (1812–1832) and Augustin Louis-Cauchy (1789–1857) 
      - abstract algebra by inventing group theory.
    - Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) 
      - differential geometry, complex variable theory
    - Augustin-Louis Cauchy
      - partial differential equations

      - calculus of variations, classical mechanics, the implicit function theorem
    - Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897) 
      - real and complex analysis with numerous examples and proofs

*** Anti-replicatants

   - inscrutible style
 - Bourbaki
   - Rejection of intuition of any kind
*** Gauss
#+Begin_quote
"No self-respecting architect leaves the scaffolding in place after completing the building."
#+end_quote
attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 C.E. - 1855 C.E.) in defense of his inscrutible style

*** Twentieth Century Contributions
#+Begin_quote
A proof is any completely convincing argument.
#+end_quote

** Experiments
 - Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175 C.E. –  1253 C.E.)
   - reasoned from universal to particular prediction
   - /Posterior Analytics/
 - Roger Bacon, (c. 1214 C.E. – 1294 C.E.)
   - observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and the need for independent verification.

** Org-mode solves three problems
(Kitchin, /Emacs, Org-mode + python reproducible research/, 2013)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-dUkyn_fZA

   - documents computation workflow
   - integrates text, math and code
   - produce or modifies a figure

** Org mode and Emacs
   - Emacs is written in a full programming language
   - understands LaTeX, markdown, language modes (R, Python, C, C++ and Java etc.)
   - can interact with OS
     - execute code
     - read the standard output
     - read the standard error (and insert into the buffer)

** Org-mode
   - note taking
   - TODO lists
   - differentiates between text, code and data
   - code executes in the buffer
   - enables links to files, urls
   - #+INCLUDE allows files to be broken into reusable pieces
   - exports available LaTeX, html, reveal.js etc.

** addenda							   :noexport:
The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data
analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more
sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus
on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial
details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility
makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that
actually conducted the analysis are available.
